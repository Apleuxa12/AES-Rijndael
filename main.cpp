/*
 * This project is created to show the point of Rijndael algo.
 * It's quite easy, main functions are encode and decode. (their names speak for themselves)
 * First part is used for 'key expansion', this is creation of special Rijndael key from input key.
 * Second part is used for encoding/decoding from expansed key.
 * Encoding consists of #ROUNDS rounds, more rounds: stronger cipher text.
 * I use 10 rounds.
